    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

      "    Different values of the argument `ddof` are useful in different\n",

      "\n",
      "    .. math::\n",
      "\n",
      "        \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_i{|a_i - \\bar{a}|^2 }}{N}}\n",
      "\n",
      "    which is sometimes called the \"population standard deviation\" in the field\n",
      "    of statistics because it applies the definition of standard deviation to\n",
      "    `a` as if `a` were a complete population of possible observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Many other libraries define the standard deviation of an array\n",

      "    In statistics, the resulting quantity is sometimed called the \"sample\n",
      "    standard deviation\" because if `a` is a random sample from a larger\n",
      "    population, this calculation provides the square root of an unbiased\n",
      "    estimate of the variance of the population. The use of :math:`N-1` in the\n",

      "    bias (toward lower values) in the variance estimate introduced when the\n",
      "    sample mean of `a` is used in place of the true mean of the population.\n",

      "    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute\n",

You've calculated the average (the mean) of this sample and seen that this is not exactly equal to the expected population parameter (which we know because we're generating the random variates from a specific, known distribution). You've been introduced to two ways of calculating the standard deviation; one uses $n$ in the denominator and the other uses $n-1$ (Bessel's correction).

If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*).

(**Check out p. 199 of AoS if you need to revise this**). This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places. In reality this is simply a rule of thumb; if the underlying distribution is approximately normal then your sampling distribution will already be pretty normal, but if the underlying distribution is heavily skewed then you'd want to increase your sample size."
